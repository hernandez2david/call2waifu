# call2waifu
This is a telephony project to contact directly an AI using azure capabilities

The steps of this project is to use Azure AI lab to create a call

Scenario 1: The person calls to my personal number and it rings 3 times.

If by the 3rd time, the call is not answered, this will be redirected and answered by an Artificial intelligence.
A QA bot in the middle should interact from a KB, pick one of the predefined prhases and ask the user for another question
The caller should be able to sustain a conversation with at least 3 phrases answered by the AI

Finally, the AI will read an aleatory ending speech

The AI should send me an email with the transcript of the converstaion

Conditions: 
The AI has a female voice
